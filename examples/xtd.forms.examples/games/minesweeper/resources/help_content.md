## Introduction

### What is Minesweeper ?

When playing Minesweeper you are presented with a mine field, and your objective is to locate all the mines as quickly as possible. To do this you uncover the squares on the game board that do not contains mines, and you mark the squares that do contain mines. The trick is determining wich squares are which.

If you uncover all the squares without mines, you win; if you uncover a mine instead of marking it you lose the game. The faster you play, the lower your score. You can use the counters at the top of the playing area to keep track of your progress.

The counter in the the upper-right corner of the playing area is a timer, wich displays your playing time in seconds. The timer does not begin counting until you select a square.

The couter in the upper-left corner of the playing area initally indicates the number of mines hidden in the mine filed. Every time you mark a square as a mine, this number decreases by one, even if you incorrectly mark a square.
