    /// @brief Executes an operation on a separate thread.
    /// @remarks The background_worker class allows you to run an operation on a separate, dedicated thread. Time-consuming operations like downloads and database transactions can cause your user interface (UI) to seem as though it has stopped responding while they are running. When you want a responsive UI and you are faced with long delays associated with such operations, the background_worker class provides a convenient solution.
    /// @remarks To execute a time-consuming operation in the background, create a background_worker and listen for events that report the progress of your operation and signal when your operation is finished.
    /// @remarks To set up for a background operation, add an event handler for the do_work event. Call your time-consuming operation in this event handler. To start the operation, call run_worker_async. To receive notifications of progress updates, handle the progress_changed event. To receive a notification when the operation is completed, handle the run_worker_completed event.
    /// @note You must be careful not to manipulate any user-interface objects in your do_work event handler. Instead, communicate to the user interface through the progress_changed and run_worker_completed events.
    /// @remarks If your background operation requires a parameter, call run_worker_async with your parameter. Inside the do_work event handler, you can extract the parameter from the do_work_event_args.argument property.
