    /// @brief Represents a Windows button control.
    /// @remarks A Button can be clicked by using the mouse, ENTER key, or SPACEBAR if the button has focus.
    /// @remarks Set the accept_button or cancel_button property of a form to allow users to click a button by pressing the ENTER or ESC keys even if the button does not have focus. This gives the form the behavior of a dialog box.
    /// @remarks When you display a form using the show_dialog method, you can use the dialog_result property of a button to specify the return value of show_dialog.
    /// @remarks You can change the button's appearance. For example, to make it appear flat for a Web look, set the flat_style property to flat_style::flat. The flat_style property can also be set to flat_style::popup, which appears flat until the mouse pointer passes over the button; then the button takes on the standard Windows button appearance.
    /// @note If the control that has focus accepts and processes the ENTER key press, the button does not process it. For example, if a multiline text_box or another button has focus, that control processes the ENTER key press instead of the accept button.
