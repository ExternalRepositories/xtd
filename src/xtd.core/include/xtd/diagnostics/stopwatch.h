    /// @remarks A stopwatch instance can measure elapsed time for one interval, or the total of elapsed time across multiple intervals. In a typical stopwatch scenario, you call the start method, then eventually call the stop method, and then you check elapsed time using the Elapsed property.
    /// @remarks A stopwatch instance is either running or stopped; use IsRunning to determine the current state of a stopwatch. Use start to begin measuring elapsed time; use stop to stop measuring elapsed time. Query the elapsed time value through the properties Elapsed, ElapsedMilliseconds, or ElapsedTicks. You can query the elapsed time properties while the instance is running or stopped. The elapsed time properties steadily increase while the stopwatch is running; they remain constant when the instance is stopped.
    /// @remarks By default, the elapsed time value of a stopwatch instance equals the total of all measured time intervals. Each call to start begins counting at the cumulative elapsed time; each call to stop ends the current interval measurement and freezes the cumulative elapsed time value. Use the reset method to clear the cumulative elapsed time in an existing stopwatch instance.
    /// @remarks The stopwatch measures elapsed time by counting timer ticks in the underlying timer mechanism. If the installed hardware and operating system support a high-resolution performance counter, then the stopwatch class uses that counter to measure elapsed time. Otherwise, the stopwatch class uses the system timer to measure elapsed time. Use the Frequency and IsHighResolution fields to determine the precision and resolution of the stopwatch timing implementation.
    /// @remarks The stopwatch class assists the manipulation of timing-related performance counters within managed code. Specifically, the Frequency field and get_timestamp method can be used in place of the unmanaged Win32 APIs QueryPerformanceFrequency and QueryPerformanceCounter.
