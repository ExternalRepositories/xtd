Following a consistent set of naming conventions in the development of a framework can be a major contribution to the framework’s usability.
It allows the framework to be used by many developers on widely separated projects.
Beyond consistency of form, names of framework elements must be easily understood and must convey the function of each element.
The goal of this chapter is to provide a consistent set of naming conventions that results in names that make immediate sense to developers.
Although adopting these naming conventions as general code development guidelines would result in more consistent naming throughout your code, you are required only to apply them to APIs that are publicly exposed (public or protected types and members, and explicitly implemented interfaces).
